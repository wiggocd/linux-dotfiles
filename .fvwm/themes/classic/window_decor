#  Below I will write rather simple
#  multipixmap window decoration.
#
#  I'm going to have pixmaps for 
#  left edge of titlebar, rest of 
#  titlebar and four pixmaps for buttons - 
#  I use pretty boring _[]X layout,
#  having the rest of functions on
#  hotkeys and as window menu entries.
#
#  I am going to have different 
#  set of decorations for active 
#  and inactive windows, which
#  makes 14 pixmaps total.
#
#  One can write more complicated 
#  or simple themes - eleven pixmaps
#  can be used for titlebar alone, 
#  tiled or stretced, pixmap or vector
#  pictures can be set for all ten 
#  buttons fvwm allows to have on the
#  titlebar, separate picture for 
#  each of button states.
#
#  As usual, refer to manuals for 
#  list of all options fvwm suggests.
#
#  Back to my theme, though. 

#  Let's start with the titlebar, 
#  tiling the pixmaps left to right.
#  I would, for simplicity, name 
#  the pixmaps like StateWhereItGoes.xpm
#
#  I would use xpm to be able to change
#  colors with simple script in future,
#  but fvwm has png support as well.
#
#  Let's set titlebar height (optional)
#  first and make window title left
#  aligned (also optional)

TitleStyle Height 18
TitleStyle LeftJustified

#  Now that we know what height the titlebar 
#  has you can set up a nice looking font
#  in fonts file in this folder

TitleStyle Active HGradient 64 #000180 #1084D0 -- flat
TitleStyle Inactive Solid #2E3436 -- flat

#  Set border width and handle width
#  They should be the same, or else 
#  greater value is used.

Style * BorderWidth 4
Style * HandleWidth 4

#  IMPORTANT! Colorset numeration
#  convention given in manuals is:
#    0 = Default colors
#    1 = Inactive windows
#    2 = Active windows
#    3 = Inactive menu entry and menu background
#    4 = Active menu entry
#    5 = greyed out menu entry (only bg used)
#    6 = module foreground and background
#    7 = hilight colors

#  Keeping this in mind, define colorsets 
#  for window borders: 

BorderStyle Active Colorset 8 -- raised 
BorderStyle Inactive Colorset 9 -- sunk
Colorset 8 bg #cccccc
Colorset 9 bg #222222

#  One more thing to specify here is 
#  colors in which window titles are
#  written - again, different for active
#  and inactive windows: 

Style "*" HilightFore #EEEEEE
Style "*" Color #797979
